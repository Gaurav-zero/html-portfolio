<h1>The best animes according to Gaurav.</h1>
<h2> My top 5 favourite animes.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. FMAB </H3>
    <P> It is my most favourite anime because of the concise and near perfect story. The representation of seven sins was so perfect and the vibe was really great.</p>
<h3> 2. Steins Gate</h3>
<p> I love this anime so much. The time travel, the sufferings of Okabe were depicted so wonderfully in this anime. The little fights between Makise and Okabe were cherry on top. Many people say they found the anime slow and didn't like the first few episodes but I really loved those early episodes. They were so funny, light-hearted and great introduction of the crazy character of Okabe. Goated anime. "EL PSY CONGROO".
</p>
<h3> 3. Code Geass</h3>
<p> This show has my favourite character of all time, Lelouch Vi Brittania. This show has by far the best ending I have ever seen(obviously not counting what they been doing to the series in recent years). Lelouch was what Eren wanted to be.

<h3> 4. Attack of Titan</h3>
<p> I don't think this show needs any introduction. Almost everyone has watched it and loved it. Even people like me whose favourite anime is not AOT can agree that AOT is peak fiction. If someone who have never watched anime, and don't want to watch it ever, should leave his hate for a few days and watch AOT thinking he's not watching anime. I'd go as far as saying that this is the best show mankind has ever produced.

<h3> 5. Hunter x Hunter</h3>
<p> One of the only shonen animes I love(not a fan of shonen, although do like jjk and ds as well). This show has a heap of great characters, from hisoka to chrollo, form netero to zeno, from feitan to Kurapika, Illumi, his dad, Leorio and who can forget King Meruem(the goat of character development) along with that blind girl. Absolute top show. Hope they resume it asap.
